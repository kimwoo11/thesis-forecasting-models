# Multi-step Prediction Models for Forecasting Supply Chain Demands

This repository contains the code base for my undergraduate thesis on exploring multivariate,
multi-step forecasting models in an effort to predict supply chain demands using Unilever's shipment
data. 

## Explored Models

Completed models:

1. Vector Autoregression Model (VAR) 
2. Convolutional + Recurrent Neural Network (LSTNet)
3. Convolutional + Recurrent Neural Network for Multi-step Forecasting (MultiLSTNet)
4. Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)
5. Transformer Encoder
